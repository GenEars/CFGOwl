# One can optionally specify how to encode terminals using the
# `terminal` directive.
# The terminal directive needs to point to a python file containing
# the implementation of a function of the form 
# `def parse_terminal(input: str) -> str`.
# The function takes one string parameter which is a terminal and should
# return the IRI that will be used for the terminal.
# This allows the usage of individuals already defined on other sources
# instead of new individuals.
#
# terminal: "./parser/individual.py"

# Brackets in input file can be customized using the `brackets` directive
# brackets: "()"
